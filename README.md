# WCMS in Containers
This demo will set up two Docker containers, one running a web content management system 
at first) the other one running the database server, used by the WCMS. The idea is to be 
able to choose the software (e.g. either WordPress or Joomla! for the WCMS) providing the 
two components from a simple console-based menu. The project is in fact conceptually finished 
now on a basic level, but there are some annoying bugs that I don't have the time to track
down right now, unfortunately.

So, this is still a work in progress...
